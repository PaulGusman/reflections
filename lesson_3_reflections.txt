When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to be able to access a project anywhere other than your local computer.
-ie on projects with other collaborators or if you're on a diff pc

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- You dont want half finished versions of code being released.
- things that arent ready to be released.
