When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to be able to access a project anywhere other than your local computer.
-ie on projects with other collaborators or if you're on a diff pc

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- You dont want half finished versions of code being released.
- things that arent ready to be released.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

- forks are a remote clone of a repository that is created and exists on GitHub
- forks attribute proper credit and ownership when (borrowing or editing) code
- clones can be to local repositories or remote ones
- clones automatically set up git remote destinations..... when u want to push
- branches are for different versions of code,
-branches can be local or remote

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- you can work on a copy of it without internet access, and incorporate
-new changes into the version you have been working on
